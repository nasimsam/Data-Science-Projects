**Predictive Modeling for Used Car Prices and Google App Ratings**
<br>
- Utilized data wrangling and preprocessing techniques to clean and transform large datasets for predictive modeling
- Applied feature engineering to select and extract relevant features, resulting in improved model performance
- Developed and trained a supervised machine learning model to predict:
  - Used car prices based on various vehicle characteristics, such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition
  - Google app ratings based on user reviews, ratings, and other relevant factors

**Predictive modeling for flight ticket prices**
<br>
The goal of this project is to develop a machine-learning model that accurately predicts flight fares for any given journey. To achieve this, I followed a structured approach:
- Data analysis: I began by analyzing the data to gain a deeper understanding of its characteristics, including the relationships between different attributes.
- Feature Engineering: Next, I performed data preprocessing, standardized the data, and converted all non-numeric attributes to numeric formats using techniques such as one-hot encoding and label encoding. Then, I selected the most relevant features to include in the model.
- Model Development: Using machine learning techniques, I built a random forest regression model to predict flight fares. To optimize the model's performance, I performed hyperparameter tuning.
