**Data Science Project: Predictive Modeling for Used Car Prices and Google App Ratings**
<br>
- Utilized data wrangling and preprocessing techniques to clean and transform large datasets for predictive modeling
- Applied feature engineering to select and extract relevant features, resulting in improved model performance
- Developed and trained a supervised machine learning model to predict:
  - Used car prices based on various vehicle characteristics, such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition
  - Google app ratings based on user reviews, ratings, and other relevant factors
